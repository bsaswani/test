    <p>Longer Duration: Unlike the 2017 total eclipse, which lasted around 2 minutes, this year’s eclipse will be especially dark and last for nearly 4½ minutes. The moon’s position in its orbit, relatively close to Earth, contributes to this extended duration.
        Active Sun: In 2024, the sun will be close to solar maximum, the peak of its roughly 11-year activity cycle. This means that bright, petal-like streamers of plasma will extend from the sun’s outer atmosphere (corona). Scientists will have more telescopes, sensors, and satellites available to study the sun during this event.
        Accessible Path: Approximately 32 million people will be within the path of totality, which stretches from Mexico to Canada. Major East Coast cities like Baltimore to Boston are also close to the path. This accessibility makes it a rare opportunity for both casual observers and scientists alike.
        Last Major Eclipse: The 2024 eclipse will be the last major eclipse to cross North America for the next 20 years. It’s a chance for millions to witness one of the most astounding astronomical events of their lives</p>
